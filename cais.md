At the top, write your first and last name, as well as your USC email address. <br />
In one or two sentences, present your project to us! <br />
<br />
**Dataset:** Indicate the dataset you chose to use, any preprocessing steps that were applied, as well as the reasoning behind these choices. <br />
**Model Development and Training:** Discuss your model implementation choices, the training procedure, the conditions you settled on (e.g., hyperparameters), and discuss why these are a good set for your task. <br />
**Model Evaluation/Results:** Present the metrics you chose and your model evaluation results. <br />
**Discussion:** <br />
How well does your dataset, model architecture, training procedures, and chosen metrics fit the task at hand? <br />
Can your efforts be extended to wider implications, or contribute to social good? Are there any limitations in your methods that should be considered before doing so?
If you were to continue this project, what would be your next steps? <br />
<br />
**Tips** <br />
Based on computational power available to you, please adjust the size of the dataset + model accordingly. Keeping this in mind, your final model performance will not be a strong factor we consider when judging the quality of your project. <br />
We recommend you choose a dataset and respective task that best aligns with your interests/future project prospects in CAIS++. <br />
The project should take you a maximum of 10 hours. If you ever need help, please reach out to Karina Yang, Aryan Gulati, another e-board member, or your peers on Slack in #f22_curriculum and/or #debugging. <br />
You are free to use any code you find online, but please do cite this in your submission. If you are collaborating, make it clear to us. You will still each need to submit your own work. <br />
